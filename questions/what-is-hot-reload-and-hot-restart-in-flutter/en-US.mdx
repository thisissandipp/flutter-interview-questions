title: What is `Hot Reload` and `Hot Restart` in Flutter?
---

Flutter's `Hot Reload` feature injects the updated source code files into the running **Dart Virtual Machine (VM)**, and rebuilds the widget tree preserving the app state to quickly view the effects of the changes.

Whereas `Hot Restart` loads the updated source code files into the VM and restarts the Flutter app, losing all the previous app states.
