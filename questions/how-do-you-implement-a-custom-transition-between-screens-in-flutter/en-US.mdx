title: How do you implement a custom transition between screens in flutter?
---

To implement a custom transition between screens in flutter:

- Use `PageRouteBuilder` to define the transition animations.
- In the `pageBuilder`, define the widget for the new screen and use `Animation` objects to control the transition.
- In the `transitionsBuilder`, use Flutter's animation widgets like `FadeTransition`, `SlideTransition`, or custom combinations to animate the transition.
- Pass the `PageRouteBuilder` to the `Navigator.push` method.

```dart
Navigator.push(
  context,
  PageRouteBuilder(
    pageBuilder: (context, animation, secondaryAnimation) => NewScreen(),
    transitionsBuilder: (context, animation, secondaryAnimation, child) {
      final begin = Offset(1.0, 0.0);
      final end = Offset.zero;
      final tween = Tween(begin: begin, end: end);
      final offsetAnimation = animation.drive(tween);

      return SlideTransition(position: offsetAnimation, child: child);
    },
  ),
);
```
