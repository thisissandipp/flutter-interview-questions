title: What are packages and plugins in Flutter?
---

A package only contains Dart code. Some of the packages may use Flutter specific functionality and thus have a dependency on the Flutter framework.

A plugin contains Dart combined with one or more platform-specific native (Java/Swift/JavaScript) code. The API of the plugin is written in Dart and the implementations are written in native languages. Flutter uses platform channels to communicate with native codes.
