title: What is `InheritedWidget` in Flutter?
---

`InheritedWidget` is a class in the Flutter framework that is used to pass data down the widget tree. It provides a convenient way to share data between widgets without having to pass the data explicitly through each individual widget in the tree.

An `InheritedWidget` is a widget that, when it is inserted into the widget tree, can be accessed by descendant widgets using the `context.inheritFromWidgetOfExactType` method. This allows data to be passed down the tree to widgets that are nested several levels deep, without having to pass the data through every single widget in between.

`InheritedWidget` is often used to provide data to descendant widgets that is frequently required, such as the theme or the current locale. By wrapping your application in an `InheritedWidget`, you can make this data available to all of your widgets, and avoid having to pass it down through multiple levels of the widget tree.
