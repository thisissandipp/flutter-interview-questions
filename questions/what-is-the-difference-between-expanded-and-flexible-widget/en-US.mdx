title: What is the difference between `Expanded` and `Flexible` widget?
---

The only difference between these two widgets is the `Flexible` widget takes only the space needed by the child, whereas the `Expanded` widget enforces its child to take all the available space.

The `Expanded` widget in flutter is shorthand of `Flexible` with the fit set to **FlexFit. tight**.

```dart
Column(children: [
  Row(
    children: [_ExpandedWidget(), _FlexibleWidget()],
  ),
  Row(
    children: [_ExpandedWidget(), _ExpandedWidget()],
  ),
  Row(
    children: [_FlexibleWidget(), _FlexibleWidget()],
  ),
]),
```
