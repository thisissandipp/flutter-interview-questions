title: What is the difference between Cupertino and Material Design in Flutter?
---

Cupertino and Material Design are two design languages used in Flutter for building iOS and Android apps, respectively. While both design languages follow different design principles and have unique features, they share some similarities as well.

Here are some of the main differences between Cupertino and Material Design in Flutter:

1. **Visual Design**: Cupertino design is characterized by its use of translucency, minimalism, and flat design, whereas Material Design uses bold typography, bright colors, and depth effects to create a layered look.

2. **Navigation and Layout**: Cupertino design uses a bottom navigation bar for app navigation and has a more top-down layout approach, while Material Design uses a drawer for navigation and has a left-to-right layout approach.

3. **Widgets**: Cupertino and Material Design have different sets of widgets that reflect their design language. For example, Cupertino widgets have a more minimalist look, with more whitespace and fewer borders, whereas Material Design widgets are more vibrant, with bright colors and more pronounced borders.

4. **Iconography**: The icons used in Cupertino and Material Design are also different. Cupertino icons have a more minimalist design, with fewer details and a more stylized look, whereas Material Design icons are more detailed and three-dimensional.

Despite these differences, both design languages share some commonalities in the way they implement responsive design and use animations to enhance the user experience. Flutter allows developers to easily switch between Cupertino and Material Design widgets and design principles, making it possible to create apps that have a consistent look and feel across both iOS and Android platforms.
