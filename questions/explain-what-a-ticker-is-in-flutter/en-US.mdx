title: Explain what a ticker is in flutter.
---

In Flutter, a ticker is a mechanism that helps to drive animations. It provides a continuous stream of time, essentially ticking at a fixed interval (typically the frame rate). This enables the animation framework to update the UI at a consistent rate.

A `Ticker` is often used with `AnimationController`, which is responsible for controlling the animation's progress over time. The Ticker's job is to notify the animation controller every frame so that it can update the animationâ€™s state, which in turn updates the UI.

```dart
class MyAnimatedWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyAnimatedWidgetState createState() => _MyAnimatedWidgetState();
}

class _MyAnimatedWidgetState extends State<MyAnimatedWidget> with TickerProviderStateMixin {
  late Ticker _ticker;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _ticker = createTicker((elapsed) {
      print('Time elapsed: $elapsed');
    });
    _ticker.start();  // Starts the ticker
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _ticker.dispose(); // Clean up the ticker
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container();
  }
}
```
