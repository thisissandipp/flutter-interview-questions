title: Explain the `mounted` property. How is it important and when to use it?
---

The mounted property defines whether the state object, associated with it, is currently in the widget tree.

After creating a State object and before calling initState, the framework **"mounts"** the State object by associating it with a BuildContext. The State object remains mounted until the framework calls dispose, after which time the framework will never ask the State object to build again.

It is an error to call setState unless mounted is true. This property is useful when a method on your state calls setState() but it isn't clear when or how often that method will be called. You can use `if (mounted) {...` to make sure the State exists before calling setState().
