title: What is the purpose of the scaffold widget in Flutter?
---

The `Scaffold` widget in Flutter is a basic structure or layout for a screen or a page in a Flutter application. It provides a visual structure for displaying a material design-style layout, which includes app bars, drawers, floating action buttons, and more.

The Scaffold widget serves as a container for different widgets, such as a `AppBar`, `BottomNavigationBar`, `Drawer`, and `FloatingActionButton`. It also provides a body property for adding the main content of the screen, and backgroundColor property for setting the background color of the screen.

Using a Scaffold widget can help to quickly build a basic structure for a Flutter application's user interface. The widgets it contains can be customized to achieve a wide range of designs and functionalities.
