title: What is the difference between `main()` and `runApp()` functions in Flutter?
---

The `main()` function tells Dart where the program starts, and it must be in the file that is considered the "entry point" for the program. By convention, this will be in a file called `main.dart`. This main function can execute any code within it's code block.

The `runApp()` function takes (as parameter) widget that would be attached to the screen as a root of the widget tree that will be rendered.
