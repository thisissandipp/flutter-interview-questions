title: What is a `CustomPainter` in Flutter?
---

In Flutter, a `CustomPainter` is a class that allows to create custom graphics and animations by painting on a Canvas. It is used in conjunction with a `CustomPaint` widget to create custom visuals that can be added to a widget tree.

To use `CustomPainter`, we need to create a class that extends `CustomPainter` and implements the `paint` and `shouldRepaint` methods. The `paint` method is where we define what to draw on the canvas, while the `shouldRepaint` method is used to determine whether to repaint the canvas when the widget is updated.

```dart
// Custom Painter
class RectanglePainter extends CustomPainter {
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    final paint = Paint()
      ..color = Colors.blue
      ..style = PaintingStyle.fill;
    final rect = Rect.fromLTWH(0, 0, size.width, size.height);
    canvas.drawRect(rect, paint);
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(RectanglePainter oldDelegate) => false;
}

// How to use the CustomPainter using CustomPaint widget
CustomPaint(
  painter: RectanglePainter(),
  size: Size(200, 200), // defines the sixe of the canvas
),
```
