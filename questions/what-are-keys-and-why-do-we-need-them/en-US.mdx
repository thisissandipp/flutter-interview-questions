title: What are keys and why do we need them?
---

Flutter uses keys to preserve the state and to uniquely identify specific widgets within a widget tree. It is used to preserve the state of the `StatefulWidget`s while they are being replaced with other widgets or just moved in the widget tree.

The most common usage of key is when we are dealing with collections of widgets that have the same type; so, without keys, the element tree would not know which state corresponds to which widget, as they would all have the same type.
