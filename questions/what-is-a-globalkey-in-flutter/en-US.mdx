title: What is a GlobalKey in Flutter?
---

A `GlobalKey` is a unique identifier for a widget in the widget tree, allowing the widget to be accessed and manipulated from outside of its parent or ancestor widgets. It is a class in the Flutter framework that can be used with stateful or stateless widgets to uniquely identify a widget.

With a `GlobalKey`, we can access a widget's state, as well as invoke its methods and properties from other widgets in the widget tree. This can be useful in situations where we need to manipulate a widget's state from outside of its parent widget, such as in form validation or when implementing animations.

However, it is important to use `GlobalKey` sparingly and only when necessary, as overuse can lead to poor code maintainability and performance issues. When possible, it is generally recommended to use the `BuildContext` object and Flutter's reactive programming model to handle state and data management in the application.
