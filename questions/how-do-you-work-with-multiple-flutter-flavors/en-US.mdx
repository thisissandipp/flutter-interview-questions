title: How do you work with multiple Flutter flavors?
---

To work with multiple Flutter flavors, follow these steps:

- Define flavors in android/app/build.gradle, add `productFlavors` like dev, staging, and prod with unique `applicationId`s.
- Set up iOS schemes, create new schemes and configuration files in Xcode for each flavor.
- Use Dart entry points, create separate main_dev.dart, main_prod.dart, etc., for flavor-specific logic.

Run/build with flavor: Use --flavor and -t flags:

```sh
flutter run --flavor dev -t lib/main_dev.dart
flutter build apk --flavor prod -t lib/main_prod.dart
```
