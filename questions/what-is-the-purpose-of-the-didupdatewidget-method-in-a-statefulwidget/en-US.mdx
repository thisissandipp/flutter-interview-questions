title: What is the purpose of the `didUpdateWidget` method in a StatefulWidget?
---

In Flutter, `StatefulWidget` is a widget that has mutable state that can change over time. When the state of a `StatefulWidget` changes, the framework rebuilds the widget tree to reflect the new state.

The `didUpdateWidget` method is a lifecycle method that is called when the framework rebuilds a `StatefulWidget`. Specifically, it is called when a new instance of the widget is created and inserted into the widget tree, and when the widget's configuration (i.e., the values of its properties) changes.

The purpose of the `didUpdateWidget` method is to allow the widget to respond to changes in its configuration. In particular, it provides an opportunity for the widget to update its state in response to changes in its properties. This can be useful, for example, if the widget needs to re-fetch data from a network service or rebuild its child widgets in response to a change in its configuration.

```dart
class MyWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  final String data;

  MyWidget({required this.data});

  @override
  _MyWidgetState createState() => _MyWidgetState();
}

class _MyWidgetState extends State<MyWidget> {
  String _data = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _data = widget.data;
  }

  @override
  void didUpdateWidget(covariant MyWidget oldWidget) {
    super.didUpdateWidget(oldWidget);
    if (widget.data != oldWidget.data) {
      setState(() {
        _data = widget.data;
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Text(_data);
  }
}
```

In this example, we define a `StatefulWidget` called `MyWidget` that takes a data parameter in its constructor. We use the `didUpdateWidget` method to update the widget's state (i.e., the `_data` variable) when the data parameter changes. When the widget is built, it displays the current value of `_data` using a `Text` widget.
