---

The Material Design Icons package in Flutter provides a set of icons that follow the Material Design guidelines for iconography. These icons are designed to be simple, easy to recognize, and scalable, making them ideal for use in mobile apps and web applications.

The Material Design Icons package contains over 4,000 icons that cover a wide range of categories, including action icons, alert icons, communication icons, content icons, device icons, editor icons, file icons, hardware icons, image icons, maps icons, navigation icons, notification icons, places icons, social icons, toggle icons, and more.

To use  Material Design Icons, first we need to add the package as a dependency to your Flutter project. Then, we can use any of the icons in the app by importing the `MaterialIcons` class and referencing the icon by name.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:material_design_icons_flutter/material_design_icons_flutter.dart';

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('My App'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Icon(MdiIcons.home),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Overall, the Material Design Icons package is a useful resource for Flutter developers, as it provides a large set of high-quality icons that can be used to enhance the user experience of their apps.
