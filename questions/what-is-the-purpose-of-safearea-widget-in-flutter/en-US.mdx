title: What is the purpose of `SafeArea` widget in Flutter?
---

The `SafeArea` widget insets its child by sufficient padding to avoid intrusions by the operating system. For example, this will indent the child by enough to avoid the status bar at the top of the screen. It will also indent the child by the amount necessary to avoid the Notch, or similar creative physical features of the display.
