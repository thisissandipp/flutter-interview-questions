title: What are different build modes in Flutter?
---

The Flutter tooling supports three different build modes while compiling the app. We need to choose the build mode depending upon where we are in the development cycle.

- `debug`: For development purpose, the **hot reload** feature is enabled only in the debug mode.
- `profile`: For analyzing the app performance. We use DevTools suite to profile app's performance.
- `release`: For releasing the app when everything is ready.
