title: What is `BuildContext` in Flutter? And why is it needed?
---

`BuildContext` is a locator that tracks and locates each widget in a widget tree. `BuildContext` objects are passed to **WidgetBuilder** functions, and are available from the `State.context` member. Some static functions (e.g. **showDialog**, **Theme.of**, and so forth) also take build contexts so that they can act on behalf of the calling widget, or obtain data specifically for the given context.

There are many reasons why `BuildContext` is important. From locating widgets in the tree to interacting with **RenderObjects**, the context makes all of these interactions possible. It serves as the **bridge** between the widgets and rendering layer and is especially powerful for combining functionality or using information from one tree in another.
