title: Can you describe how to implement internationalization in a flutter app?
---

To implement internationalization (i18n) in a Flutter app:

- Include the `flutter_localizations` package in the `pubspec.yaml` file.
- Set the `localizationsDelegates` and `supportedLocales` properties in the MaterialApp.
- Use .arb files to store translations for different locales (e.g., app_en.arb for English, app_es.arb for Spanish).
- Use the flutter `gen-l10n` tool to generate Dart localization classes from the .arb files.
- Use the generated localization class (e.g., `AppLocalizations.of(context).<key>`) to access translated strings.
- Test the app by switching locales in device settings and updating .arb files as needed.
