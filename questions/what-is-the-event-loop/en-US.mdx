title: What is the event loop?
---

In Flutter, the event loop is a mechanism used to manage the flow of events and callbacks in an application. The event loop runs on a single thread and is responsible for processing events, such as user input or network I/O, and executing any associated callbacks.

The event loop works by maintaining a queue of events and callbacks that need to be processed. When an event occurs, such as a user tapping a button, the event is added to the end of the event queue. The event loop then dequeues events from the front of the queue and executes any associated callbacks, such as updating the user interface or performing a network request.

The event loop is a crucial part of the Flutter framework, as it allows developers to create responsive and interactive applications that can handle user input and respond to changes in real-time. By using the event loop effectively, developers can ensure that their applications remain fast and responsive, even when performing complex tasks or running on slower devices.
