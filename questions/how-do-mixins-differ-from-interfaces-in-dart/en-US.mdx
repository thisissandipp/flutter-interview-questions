title: How do mixins differ from interfaces in Dart?
---

In Dart, mixins and interfaces serve different purposes:

**Mixins:** Allow a class to reuse code from multiple classes without using inheritance. Mixins are typically used to add functionality to a class. They are declared using the mixin keyword and can be applied to a class via the with keyword. A class can apply multiple mixins.

```dart
mixin Walker {
  void walk() => print("Walking");
}

class Person with Walker {
  // Person can now use the walk() method
}
```

**Interfaces:** Define a contract that a class must adhere to. In Dart, all classes implicitly act as interfaces. To implement an interface, a class uses the implements keyword. Unlike mixins, interfaces do not allow code reuseâ€”they only define method signatures that must be implemented.

```dart
class Animal {
  void eat();
}

class Dog implements Animal {
  @override
  void eat() => print("Dog eating");
}
```

**Key Differences:**
- Mixins provide code reuse; can be used with multiple classes.
- Interfaces define required methods, but no code reuse. A class can implement multiple interfaces.
