title: What is a modal bottom sheet in Flutter?
---

In Flutter, a modal bottom sheet is a type of popup that is displayed at the bottom of the screen and covers a portion of the parent widget. Modal bottom sheets are commonly used to display additional options or information that are related to the parent widget, but require additional user input to complete an action.

Modal bottom sheets are created using the `showModalBottomSheet()` method, which takes a `BuildContext` and a `builder` argument. The `builder` argument is a callback that returns a widget that represents the content of the modal bottom sheet.

```dart
showModalBottomSheet(
  context: context,
  builder: (BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      // WRITE YOUR CODE HERE
    );
  },
);
```
