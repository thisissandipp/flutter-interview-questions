title: What is an `AspectRatio` widget used for?
---

The `AspectRatio` widget in Flutter is used to ensure that a widget maintains a specific aspect ratio, regardless of the size of the parent container. This can be useful in cases where you want a widget to have a specific shape, such as a square or a rectangle with a fixed width-to-height ratio.

The aspect ratio is defined as the width of the widget divided by its height. The `AspectRatio` widget takes the aspect ratio as an argument and sets the width or height of the widget such that the aspect ratio is maintained. The other dimension is automatically adjusted to match.

For example, if you want to create a square widget, you can wrap the widget in an AspectRatio widget with an aspect ratio of 1.0, and the widget will always be square, regardless of the size of the parent container.
