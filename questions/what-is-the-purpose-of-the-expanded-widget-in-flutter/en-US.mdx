title: What is the purpose of the Expanded widget in Flutter?
---

In Flutter, the `Expanded` widget is used to adjust the available space for a child widget of a `Row`, `Column`, or `Flex` widget, by dividing the remaining free space among the children.

When an `Expanded` widget is used, the child widget of the Row, Column, or Flex takes up as much available space as possible in the direction of the `mainAxisSize` property of the parent widget. This means that if the parent widget is a Row, the Expanded widget expands the child widget horizontally, and if the parent is a Column, the Expanded widget expands the child widget vertically.

If there is more than one Expanded widget in the same Row, Column, or Flex, the available space is divided among the children based on their `flex` property, which determines the proportion of the remaining free space that each child should occupy.
