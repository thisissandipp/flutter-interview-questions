title: What is the purpose of the `Navigator` class in Flutter?
---

In Flutter, the `Navigator` class is used to manage a stack of pages or routes in an app. It provides methods to push and pop routes onto and off of the stack, allowing the user to navigate between different screens or views within the app.

Here are some of the key features and use cases of the `Navigator` class in Flutter:

1. The `Navigator` class provides methods to push and pop routes onto and off of the stack. When a route is pushed onto the stack, it becomes the topmost route and is displayed on the screen. When a route is popped off the stack, the previous route becomes the topmost route and is displayed on the screen.
2. The `Navigator` class provides a way to pass data between routes using the push method's arguments parameter.
3. The `Navigator` class allows to manage the navigation history by controlling which routes are pushed onto and popped off of the stack.
4. The `Navigator` class provides options to customize the transition animation when navigating between routes, such as sliding, fading, or scaling the new route into view.
