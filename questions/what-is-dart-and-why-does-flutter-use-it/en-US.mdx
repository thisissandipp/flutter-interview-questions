title: What is Dart and Why does Flutter use it?
---

Dart is a programming language designed for client development, such as for the web and mobile apps. It is developed by Google and can also be used to build server and desktop applications. It is an object-oriented, class-based, garbage-collected language with C-style syntax.

- Dart allows Flutter to avoid the need for a separate declarative layout language like JSX or XML, or separate visual interface builders, because Dart's declarative, programmatic layout is easy to read and visualize.
- Dart uses the Just In Time compilation. This drastically reduces the time of development and responds faster.
