title: What is `Animation` and `AnimationController`?
---

`Animation` is a way to describe a graphical representation of a changing value over time. It can be used to animate the properties of widgets, such as size, color, position, and opacity, to create smooth and visually appealing transitions.

`AnimationController` is a central class in Flutter's animation framework that is used to control the animations. It defines the duration, direction, and other properties of an animation, and provides methods for starting, stopping, and monitoring the progress of the animation.

In Flutter, animations can be created by using the `AnimationController` in combination with `Tween` and `Curve` objects, which define the animation's starting and ending values and the progression of the animation over time.

```dart
class MyAnimation extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyAnimationState createState() => _MyAnimationState();
}

class _MyAnimationState extends State<MyAnimation>
    with SingleTickerProviderStateMixin {
  AnimationController _controller;
  Animation<double> _animation;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _controller = AnimationController(
      duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
      vsync: this,
    );
    _animation = Tween<double>(begin: 0, end: 300).animate(_controller)
      ..addListener(() {
        setState(() {});
      });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      height: _animation.value,
      width: _animation.value,
      child: FlutterLogo(),
    );
  }
}
```
