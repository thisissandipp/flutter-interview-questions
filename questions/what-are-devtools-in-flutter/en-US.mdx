title: What are DevTools in Flutter?
---

`DevTools` in Flutter are a set of powerful web-based tools for debugging and profiling Flutter applications. They provide developers with detailed information about their apps, including CPU usage, memory usage, GPU rendering, and network activity. DevTools can be used to identify performance bottlenecks, inspect the widget tree, and debug issues in real-time.

Here are some of the features of DevTools:

- **Flutter inspector**: Allows us to inspect the widget tree and inspect the layout, size, and position of each widget.
- **Timeline view**: Provides a graphical representation of the performance of the app, including CPU, memory, and GPU usage.
- **Debugger**: Enables us to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through our code.
- **Logging view**: Displays log messages and errors generated by the app.
- **Hot reload**: Lets us modify oour code and see the changes reflected in the app without having to restart it.
