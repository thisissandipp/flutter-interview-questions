title: Explain singleton class in flutter.
---

A singleton class is a class that can only be instantiated once throughout the entire application. It provides a single point of access to a shared instance of an object, which can be accessed from anywhere in the application.

To create a singleton class in Flutter, we need to define a private constructor that can only be accessed within the class itself. Then, we can create a static field of the class type that holds the single instance of the class, and a static method that returns the instance. Here's an example of a singleton class in Flutter:

```dart
class MySingleton {
  static final MySingleton _singleton = MySingleton._internal();

  factory MySingleton() {
    return _singleton;
  }

  MySingleton._internal();

  void doSomething() {
    print('Singleton class is doing something');
  }
}
```

In this example, `MySingleton` is a singleton class that has a private constructor, a static field `_singleton` of the same type, and a static factory method that returns the single instance of the class. The `doSomething` method is a simple method that can be called on the instance of the class.

To use this singleton class, we can simply call the factory method to get the instance of the class, and then call the methods on the instance. Here's an example:

```dart
MySingleton singleton = MySingleton();
singleton.doSomething();
```

This will create a single instance of `MySingleton` and call the `doSomething` method on it. Since `MySingleton` is a singleton class, any subsequent calls to the `MySingleton()` constructor will simply return the existing instance of the class, rather than creating a new instance.
