title: What are the advantages of a Flutter Inspector?
---

The Flutter Inspector provides several key features that help developers debug and optimize their applications:

1. **Select Widget Mode:** Allows you to choose a widget directly from the app on your device to inspect its properties. This is useful for understanding how each widget behaves in the layout (source: Flutter Docs).

2. **Refresh Tree:** After hot reloading, the widget tree in the inspector may not immediately update. Clicking Refresh Tree reloads the widget information to reflect the latest changes (source: Flutter Docs).

3. **Slow Animations:** Slows down the animation speed by a factor of 5, allowing you to fine-tune and observe animations more clearly (source: Flutter Docs).

4. **Show Guidelines:** Overlays layout guidelines on your screen to help fix layout issues and ensure consistent UI design (source: Flutter Docs).

5. **Show Baselines:** Displays baselines used to align text, which is helpful for checking proper text alignment within the UI (source: Flutter Docs).

6. **Highlight Repaints:** Highlights areas of the screen that repaint, with borders changing colors. This helps you identify unnecessary repaints that may be affecting performance (source: Flutter Docs).

7. **Highlight Oversized Images:** Highlights images that consume too much memory by inverting their colors and flipping them, guiding you to optimize image sizes for better performance (source: Flutter Docs).

These tools enhance the debugging process and improve the performance of your Flutter app by providing in-depth visual feedback during development.
