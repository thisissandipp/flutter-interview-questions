title: How do you implement a draggable widget in flutter?
---

To implement a draggable widget in flutter, use the `Draggable` widget. Here's how to do it:

- Use the `Draggable` widget to wrap the element you want to make draggable.
- Pass the data you want to drag through the data property.
- Use `feedback` to specify the widget that appears while dragging and `childWhenDragging` for the widget that replaces the original widget during the drag.

```dart
Draggable<int>(
  data: 1,
  feedback: Material(
    color: Colors.transparent,
    child: Icon(Icons.access_alarm, size: 50),
  ),
  childWhenDragging: Container(),
  child: Icon(Icons.access_alarm),
)
```

In this example, when the user starts dragging the icon, it shows a smaller icon as the feedback. The original icon disappears until the drag ends.
