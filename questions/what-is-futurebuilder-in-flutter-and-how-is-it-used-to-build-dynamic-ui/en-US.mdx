title: What is `FutureBuilder` in Flutter and how is it used to build dynamic UI?
---

`FutureBuilder` is a widget in Flutter that allows us to build a dynamic UI based on the value of a Future. A Future is an asynchronous operation that returns a value in the future. For example, we might use a Future to retrieve data from a server, or to perform a long-running computation.

The `FutureBuilder` widget listens to the Future and builds the UI based on its state. The UI can be different for three states:

**Uncompleted**: When the Future is running, we can show a loading indicator or any other widget to indicate that the operation is in progress.

**Completed with data**: When the Future completes with data, we can use the data to build the UI. For example, we might display a list of items retrieved from the server.

**Completed with an error**: If the Future completes with an error, we can show an error message or any other widget to indicate that something went wrong.

Here's an example of using `FutureBuilder` to retrieve data from a server and display a list of items:

```dart
Future<List<String>> _fetchData() async {
  // Simulate fetching data from a server
  return Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2), () => ["Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3"]);
}

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return FutureBuilder<List<String>>(
    future: _fetchData(),
    builder: (context, snapshot) {
      if (snapshot.hasData) {
        return ListView.builder(
          itemCount: snapshot.data.length,
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return Text(snapshot.data[index]);
          },
        );
      } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
        return Text("Error: ${snapshot.error}");
      }
      return CircularProgressIndicator();
    },
  );
}
```

In this example, the `_fetchData` function returns a Future that retrieves data from a server. The `FutureBuilder` widget listens to the Future and uses the `builder` callback to build the UI based on its state. If the Future is running, the `CircularProgressIndicator` is displayed. If the Future completes with data, the data is displayed in a list. If the Future completes with an error, an error message is displayed.
