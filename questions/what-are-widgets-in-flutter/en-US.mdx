title: What are widgets in Flutter?
---

Widgets are the central class hierarchy in the Flutter framework, that describes the configuration of an element to manage the underlying render tree. A widget is an immutable description of part of a user interface. Widgets themselves have no mutable state, i.e., all their fields must be final.

In Flutter, **everything is a widget**.
