title: What is the difference between `WidgetsApp` and `MaterialApp` in Flutter?
---

`WidgetsApp` is a convenient widget that wraps a number of widgets that are commonly required for an application. It also provides basic navigation.

`MaterialApp` builds an application that uses the mterial design. It is built upon the `WidgetsApp` and contains some material-design specific functionality, such as **AnimatedTheme**. We certainly don't require `MaterialApp` every time when building a Flutter project. `CupertinoApp` gives iOS like look and feel, or we can even define our custom sets of widgets.
