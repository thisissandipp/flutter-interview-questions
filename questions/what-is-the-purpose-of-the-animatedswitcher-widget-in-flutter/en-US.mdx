title: What is the purpose of the `AnimatedSwitcher` widget in Flutter?
---

The `AnimatedSwitcher` widget in Flutter is used to create animated transitions between two or more widgets. The purpose of the `AnimatedSwitcher` widget is to provide an easy-to-use way to animate changes in the widget tree. When you use the `AnimatedSwitcher`, you can specify a new child widget to be displayed, and the `AnimatedSwitcher` will animate the transition between the old and new widgets using a customizable animation.

The `AnimatedSwitcher` widget has several properties that can be used to customize the animation, including the duration of the animation, the type of animation, and whether or not to fade the widgets in and out.

Some common use cases for the `AnimatedSwitcher` widget include:

- Swapping out one widget for another in response to user input
- Animating changes to a list of items, such as adding or removing items
- Creating smooth transitions between screens or pages in a multi-page app
