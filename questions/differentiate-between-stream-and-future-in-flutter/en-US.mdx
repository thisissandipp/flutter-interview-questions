title: Differentiate between `Stream` and `Future` in Flutter.
---

`Stream` and `Future` are both used for asynchronous programming in Flutter, but they serve different purposes.

`Future` is a one-time asynchronous operation that returns a single value. It represents a value that will be available in the future, either a result or an error. Futures are often used for short-lived operations that complete quickly, such as fetching data from a database or an API.

`Stream`, on the other hand, is a sequence of asynchronous events. A stream can emit multiple values over time, either in response to user interaction or based on some other event. Streams are useful for continuous or long-lived operations, such as listening to updates from a sensor, receiving messages from a chat service, or playing a video.

In summary, the main difference between `Future` and `Stream` is that `Future` represents a single value that will be available in the future, while `Stream` represents a sequence of values that are emitted over time.
