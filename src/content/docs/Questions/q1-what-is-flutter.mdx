Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop cross-platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, and the web from a single codebase. Flutter was released in May 2017. Developers consider it the fastest and most expressive way to create native apps. Its simplicity, high performance, and rich user interface make it a go-to choice for modern app development.
