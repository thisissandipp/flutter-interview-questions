title: What are the differences between JIT and AOT?
---

JIT stands for Just-in-Time vs AOT stands for Ahead-of-Time.

- JIT compiles code during runtime. Used in development (e.g., hot reload) but has slower performance.
- AOT compiles code before runtime (during build). Used in production for faster performance and optimized binary size.

Key Differences:

- JIT is slower, smaller binary, errors at runtime.
- AOT is faster, larger binary, errors at compile-time.

In Flutter, JIT is used in debug mode, and AOT is used in release mode for optimized apps.
