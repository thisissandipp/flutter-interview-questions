title: What is `resizeToAvoidBottomInset`? When should we use it?
---

The `resizeToAvoidBottomInset` is a property in the `Scaffold` widget. It is a boolean property that determines whether the body of the `Scaffold` should be resized to avoid the on-screen keyboard when it is displayed.

It should be used when the body of the `Scaffold` contains a form or text input fields, and it is desirable to avoid having the input fields covered by the on-screen keyboard when the user is entering text.
