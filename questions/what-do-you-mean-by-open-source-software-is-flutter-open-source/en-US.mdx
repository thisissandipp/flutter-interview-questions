title: What do you mean by open-source software? Is Flutter open-source?
---

Open-source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance. Open-source software is developed in a decentralized and collaborative way, relying on peer review and community production. Open source software is often cheaper, more flexible, and has more longevity than its proprietary peers because it is developed by communities rather than a single author or company.

Yes, Flutter is an open-source software development kit.
