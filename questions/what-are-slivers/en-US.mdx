title: What are `Slivers`?
---

A sliver is a portion of a scrollable area that you can define to behave in a special way. You can use slivers to achieve custom scrolling effects, such as elastic scrolling.

Under the hood, slivers are used to implement all of the scrollable views you use, including ListView and GridView. Slivers can be compared to a lower-level interface that offers more precise control over the implementation of scrollable areas.

Sliver lets you render child widgets lazily or render only the visible segment of the screen. Additionally, Sliver provides a better experience when you need to scroll a list of items and a grid of items all together as a single unit or create a collapsible header. It makes the overall scrolling effect of large lists effective and efficient.
