title: What is the purpose of the `Stack` widget in Flutter?
---

In Flutter, the `Stack` widget is used to place widgets on top of each other in a specific order. It allows to position widgets at specific locations within the parent widget by using offsets or alignment.

The main purpose of the `Stack` widget is to provide a way to overlay widgets on top of each other. For example, if we want to display a text label over an image, we can use a `Stack` widget to place the text label on top of the image.

```dart
Stack(
  children: [
    Image.network('https://picsum.photos/250?image=9'),
    Center(child: Text('Hello, World!'),
  ],
),
```
