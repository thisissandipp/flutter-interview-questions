title: What is the role of the `FlutterEngine` in the Flutter framework?
---

The Flutter Engine is a portable runtime for hosting Flutter applications. It implements Flutter's core libraries, including animation and graphics, file and network I/O, accessibility support, plugin architecture, and a Dart runtime and compile toolchain. It:

- Executes Dart code in a separate isolate.
- Manages the rendering pipeline via the Skia engine.
- Facilitates communication between Flutter and native code through platform channels.
- Handles plugin integration and app lifecycle events.
