title: How do you implement a custom animation curve in flutter?
---

To implement a custom animation curve in Flutter:

- Create a custom class that extends `Curve` and override the `transform` method to define the curve's behavior.
- Apply the custom curve in an `Animation` object using `CurvedAnimation`.

```dart
class CustomCurve extends Curve {
  @override
  double transform(double t) {
    // Example: Ease-in-out quadratic curve
    return t < 0.5 ? 2 * t * t : -1 + (4 - 2 * t) * t;
  }
}

final animation = CurvedAnimation(
  parent: controller,
  curve: CustomCurve(),
);
```
