title: What is sound null safety?
---

**Sound null safety** makes types in code non-nullable by default and enables special static checks and compiler optimizations to guarantee that null-dereference errors won't appear at runtime because they will be spotted at compile-time and fixed.

**Null safety** is a guarantee within an object-oriented programming language that no object references will have null or void values.
