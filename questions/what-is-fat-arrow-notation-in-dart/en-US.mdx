title: What is Fat Arrow Notation in Dart?
---

A fat arrow (=>) is used to define a single expression in a function. This is a cleaner way to write functions with a single statement.

Syntax:

```
ReturnType FunctionName(Params) => Expression;
```

Example:

```dart
// Without fat arrow notation
String findSquare(int n) {
  return 'The square of $n is ${n * n}.';
}

// With fat arrow notation
String findSquare(int n) => 'The square of $n is ${n * n}.';
```
