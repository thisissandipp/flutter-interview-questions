title: What are mixins? How to use them?
---

A mixin is a class whose methods and properties can be used by other classes â€“ without subclassing. It's a reusable chunk of code that can be plugged in to any class that needs this functionality.

Example of a mixin:

```dart
// To create a mixin, use `mixin` keyword instead of `class`.
mixin GreetingsMixin {
  String greeting = 'Hello people';

  void introduce() => print('$greeting, I am Sandip.');
}

// The following example shows two classes that use the above mixin.
class Something extends MyClass with GreetingsMixin {
  // ...
}

class SomethingElse extends MyAnotherClass with GreetingsMixin {
  SomethingElse() {
    greeting = 'Hi everyone';
  }
}

// Here is how to use them
SomethingElse obj = SomethingElse();
obj.introduce();  // Hi everyone, I am Sandip.
```

Sometimes you want to restrict from mixing in functionality to classes that have no deal with the mixin. To restrict a mixin, use the 'on' keyword to specify the required subclass.

```dart
class SocialMedia {
  // ...
}

// Create a mixin restricted on [SocialMedia] class
mixin SocialMediaGreetings on SocialMedia {
  String greeting = 'Hello people';

  void introduce() => print('$greeting, I am Sandip.');
}

// Only classes that extend or implement the [SocialMedia] class
// can use the mixin [SocialMediaGreetings]
class Twitter extends SocialMedia with SocialMediaGreetings {
  Twitter() {
    greeting = 'Hello Tweeple';
  }
}
```
