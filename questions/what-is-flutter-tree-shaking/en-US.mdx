title: What is Flutter Tree Shaking?
---

`Tree shaking` is a technique used by modern compilers to reduce the size of the output by eliminating code that is not being used. In Flutter, `tree shaking` refers to the process of removing unused widgets, libraries, and other code from the final build of an application. This helps to reduce the size of the application and improve performance by only including the code that is actually used by the application.

Tree shaking in Flutter works by analyzing the dependencies of each widget and only including the widgets that are actually used in the final build. This means that if a widget or library is not used, it will not be included in the final build, reducing the size and improving the performance of the application.

In summary, Flutter Tree shaking is a feature that helps to optimize the size and performance of Flutter applications by only including the code that is actually used.
