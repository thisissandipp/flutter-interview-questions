title: How do you navigate between screens in Flutter?
---

In Flutter, we can navigate between screens using the `Navigator` class. We can push a new screen onto the stack using the `push` method, and pop the current screen off the stack using the `pop` method. We can also use named routes to navigate between screens. To do this, we need to define a map of named routes in the `MaterialApp`, and then use the `Navigator.pushNamed` method to navigate to a specific named route.

Here are the basic steps to navigate between screens in Flutter:

1. Define the screens or pages as separate widgets, each with its own unique name and content.
2. Use the `Navigator.push()` method to push a new Route onto the stack.
   ```dart
   Navigator.push(
     context,
     MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => SecondScreen()),
   );
   ```
3. Now, to go back to the previous screen use the `Navigator.pop()` method.
   ```dart
   Navigator.pop(context),
   ```
