`FlutterActivity` is the simplest and most direct way to integrate Flutter within an Android app.

`FlutterActivity` maintains the following responsibilities:

- Displays an Android launch screen.
- Configures the status bar appearance.
- Chooses the Dart execution app bundle path, entrypoint and entrypoint arguments.
- Chooses Flutter's initial route.
- Renders Activity transparently, if desired.
- Offers hooks for subclasses to provide and configure a `FlutterEngine`.
- Save and restore instance state.
