title: What is the purpose of the `SingleChildScrollView` widget in Flutter?
---

The `SingleChildScrollView` widget in Flutter is used to make its child widget scrollable if it overflows the parent container.

The purpose of `SingleChildScrollView` is to provide a way to display content that is larger than the available space. This widget is often used when a widget contains a large amount of content that doesn't fit on the screen, such as a long list of items, a large image, or a form with many input fields.

By wrapping the child widget in a `SingleChildScrollView`, the user can scroll through the content to see all of it. The `SingleChildScrollView` widget takes up as much space as its child widget requires, and allows the child to be scrolled vertically or horizontally to view all of its content.

Here's an example of using `SingleChildScrollView` to create a scrollable list:

```dart
SingleChildScrollView(
  child: Column(
    children: <Widget>[
      ListTile(title: Text('Item 1')),
      ListTile(title: Text('Item 2')),
      ListTile(title: Text('Item 3')),
      // Add more items here...
    ],
  ),
);
```

In this example, the `SingleChildScrollView` wraps a `Column` widget containing several `ListTile` widgets. If the content of the `Column` is too large to fit on the screen, the user can scroll through it to see all of the items.
