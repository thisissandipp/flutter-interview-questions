title: What is the purpose of the `LayoutBuilder` widget in Flutter?
---

The `LayoutBuilder` widget in Flutter is used to get the constraints of the parent widget and build child widgets based on these constraints.

The purpose of `LayoutBuilder` is to enable creating responsive UIs that adapt to the size of their parent widget. The `LayoutBuilder` widget provides a callback that takes in the `BoxConstraints` of the parent widget, which represent the minimum and maximum width and height of the widget.

These constraints can be used to build child widgets that fit within the available space. For example, the `MediaQuery.of(context).size` property can be used to to get the screen size, and then using the `LayoutBuilder` widget to create a child widget that adjusts its size based on the screen size.

Here's an example of using LayoutBuilder to create a widget that adjusts its size based on the available space:

```dart
LayoutBuilder(
  builder: (BuildContext context, BoxConstraints constraints) {
    return Container(
      width: constraints.maxWidth * 0.5,
      height: constraints.maxHeight * 0.5,
      child: Text('This widget will take up 50% of the available space'),
    );
  },
);
```

In this example, the `Container` widget will take up 50% of the available width and height, based on the `BoxConstraints` provided by the `LayoutBuilder`. This allows the widget to adjust its size based on the available space, making it more responsive.
