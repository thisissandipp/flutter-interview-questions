title: What is the difference between padding and margin in Flutter?
---

In Flutter, `padding` and `margin` are two properties used to adjust the spacing between widgets in the layout.

- Padding is the amount of space added within a widget, between its content and its border. It affects the layout of the widget and increases the size of the widget. Padding is set using the `padding` property of a widget and can be applied to any widget.

- Margin is the amount of space added outside a widget, between the widget and its parent container. It does not affect the layout of the widget but rather positions the widget within its parent. Margin is set using the `margin` property of a widget and can only be applied to widgets that are inside a container.

In summary, `padding` is used to adjust the space inside a widget while `margin` is used to adjust the space outside a widget. Both `padding` and `margin` are important properties for achieving the desired layout and spacing between widgets in a Flutter application.
