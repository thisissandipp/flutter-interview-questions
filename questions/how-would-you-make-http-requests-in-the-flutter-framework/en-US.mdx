title: How would you make HTTP requests in the Flutter framework?
---

Making HTTP requests in Flutter can be done using the `http` package. This package provides a simple API for sending HTTP requests and receiving HTTP responses.

Here is an example of how to make a GET request to retrieve data from an API:

```dart
import 'dart:convert';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

Future<void> fetchData() async {
  final response = await http.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');

  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    // If the server did return a 200 OK response, then parse the JSON
    final data = json.decode(response.body);
    print(data);
  } else {
    // If the server did not return a 200 OK response, then throw an exception
    throw Exception('Failed to load data');
  }
}
```

In this example, we use the `http.get` method to send a GET request to the specified URL. The `await` keyword is used to wait for the response before continuing. If the response has a status code of 200, we parse the JSON data using the `json.decode` method. If the status code is not 200, we throw an exception.

The `http` package is a simple and powerful tool for making HTTP requests in Flutter, and it can be used for a variety of tasks, including retrieving data from APIs, submitting form data, and uploading files.
