title: What is Factory constructor?
---

A factory constructor in Flutter is a special type of constructor that returns an instance of a class, but it does not necessarily create a new object every time it's called. The purpose of a factory constructor is to allow classes to provide alternative ways to create objects without exposing the implementation details of the object creation process. For example, a factory constructor could return an instance from a cache, return a subtype of the class, or use a factory method to create an instance.

In Flutter, factory constructors are declared using the `factory` keyword and have no body. Instead, they return an instance of the class, which can be an instance of the class, a subtype of the class, or a completely different type. This allows clients of the class to create objects in different ways, depending on their needs.

For example:

```dart
class Rectangle {
  final double width;
  final double height;

  Rectangle(this.width, this.height);

  factory Rectangle.square(double side) {
    return Rectangle(side, side);
  }
}
```

In this example, the factory constructor `Rectangle.square` takes a side parameter and returns a Rectangle object with equal width and height. This allows clients of the Rectangle class to create square objects without knowing how squares are implemented as rectangles.

This helps to create a more flexible and reusable codebase, and it also makes it easier to maintain and test the code.
