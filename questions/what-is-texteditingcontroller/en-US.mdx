title: What is `TextEditingController`?
---

The `TextEditingController` is a class in the Flutter framework that provides control over the text in a text field. It allows you to read and modify the text, set the selection, and listen to changes to the text.

It is typically used in conjunction with a `TextField` widget to create an editable text input field in a Flutter application. The `TextEditingController` is assigned to the `controller` property of the `TextField`, and it can be used to retrieve the entered text, set the initial text, or respond to changes in the text.
