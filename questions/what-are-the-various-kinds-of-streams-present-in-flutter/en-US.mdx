title: What are the various kinds of Streams present in flutter?
---

Streams in flutter are of two main types:

**Single Subscription Stream**
- Allows a single listener to subscribe at a time.
- Suitable for sequential data processing, like events or user input.
- Commonly used in situations like button clicks or network requests.

**Broadcast Stream**

- Allows multiple listeners to subscribe simultaneously.
- Ideal for scenarios where the same data needs to be shared across multiple listeners.
- Often used for shared events, like a global notification system.
