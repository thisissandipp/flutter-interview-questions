title: What is `pubspec.yaml` file and what does it do?
---

Every Flutter project includes a `pubspec.yaml` file, which is generated while creating a new Flutter project. Itâ€™s located at the top of the project tree and contains metadata about the project that the Dart and Flutter tooling needs to know.

The pubspec file specifies dependencies that the project requires, such as particular packages (and their versions), fonts, or image files. It also specifies other requirements, such as dependencies on developer packages (like testing or mocking packages), or particular constraints on the version of the Flutter SDK.
