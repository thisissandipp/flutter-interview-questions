title: What are platform channels in Flutter and when would you use them?
---

Platform channels in Flutter enable communication between Flutterâ€™s Dart code and the host platform's native code (e.g., Java/Kotlin on Android or Swift/Objective-C on iOS). They are used when you need to access platform-specific APIs or features not directly available in Flutter.

When to use them:

- Accessing device hardware (camera, GPS, sensors).
- Using platform-specific libraries or SDKs.
- Integrating native functionality like notifications or background services.

Example:
Using a platform channel to get the battery level:

```dart
// Dart (Flutter)
const platform = MethodChannel('samples.flutter.dev/battery');
final batteryLevel = await platform.invokeMethod('getBatteryLevel');
```

```java
// Android (Native)
new MethodChannel(getFlutterEngine().getDartExecutor().getBinaryMessenger(), "samples.flutter.dev/battery")
    .setMethodCallHandler((call, result) -> {
        if (call.method.equals("getBatteryLevel")) {
            int batteryLevel = getBatteryLevel(); // Native method
            result.success(batteryLevel);
        } else {
            result.notImplemented();
        }
    });
```
