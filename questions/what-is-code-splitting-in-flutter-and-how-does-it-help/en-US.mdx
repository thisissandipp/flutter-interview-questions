title: What is code-splitting in Flutter, and how does it help?
---

In Flutter, code-splitting refers to dividing your app's code into smaller, independent modules that can be loaded on demand, rather than loading the entire app at once. This technique is typically used with deferred components or dynamic libraries.

**Benefits:**
- Reduced initial load time, only essential parts of the app are loaded upfront, improving performance.
- Optimized memory usage, non-essential features remain unloaded until needed.
- Improved user experience, faster startup and efficient navigation.

**How it helps:**
For example, in large Flutter apps, you can defer loading less frequently used features, like onboarding screens or admin dashboards, using tools like deferred components in Android or iOS.

In practice, it enhances scalability and performance, especially in apps with extensive functionality.
